CSC 216 Portfolio Template
==========================

https://github.com/reberhardt7/csc216-portfolio/

This is a LaTeX document class I wrote for the Harper College CSC 216 Data
Structures and Algorithms class to organize and submit my homework. Please see
[template.tex](template.tex) and [template.pdf](template.pdf) for example
usage. I hope someone else may find it useful. Please
[contact me](http://reberhardt.com/#connect) if you have questions on how to
adapt it; I plan to make it more customizable in the future.
